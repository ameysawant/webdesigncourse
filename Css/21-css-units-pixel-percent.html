            RULES: 
            1. A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted.
            2. For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.

            Absolute Lengths -
            The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
            Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen

            Relative Lengths -
            Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.
