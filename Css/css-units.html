        1. CSS has several different units for expressing a length.
        2. Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.
        3. Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.
        4. For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.
        5. There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

        Absolute Lengths -
        1. The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
        2. Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen

        Unit	Description
        cm       centimeters
        mm	    millimeters
        in	      inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
        px *     pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
        pt	      points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
        pc	      picas (1pc = 12 pt)


        Relative Lengths
        1. Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.

        Unit	Description	
        em	    Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
        ex	     Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
        ch	     Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)	
        rem	    Relative to font-size of the root element	
        vw	     Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
        vh	     Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
        vmin    Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
        vmax   Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
        %	      Relative to the parent element


        Note: A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted.
