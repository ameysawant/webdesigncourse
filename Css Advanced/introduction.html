            translate3d(x,y,z) - Defines a 3D translation
            translateX(x) - Defines a 3D translation, using only the value for the X-axis
            translateY(y) - Defines a 3D translation, using only the value for the Y-axis
            translateZ(z) - Defines a 3D translation, using only the value for the Z-axis
            scale3d(x,y,z) - Defines a 3D scale transformation
            scaleX(x) - Defines a 3D scale transformation by giving a value for the X-axis
            scaleY(y) - Defines a 3D scale transformation by giving a value for the Y-axis
            scaleZ(z) - Defines a 3D scale transformation by giving a value for the Z-axis
            rotate3d(x,y,z,angle) - Defines a 3D rotation
            rotateX(angle) - Defines a 3D rotation along the X-axis
            rotateY(angle) - Defines a 3D rotation along the Y-axis
            rotateZ(angle) - Defines a 3D rotation along the Z-axis
            perspective(n) - Defines a perspective view for a 3D transformed element

    3. CSS Transitions
        CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.
            transition
            transition-delay
            transition-duration
            transition-property
            transition-timing-function

        Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition:
        The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
        The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:
        ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
        linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
        ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
        ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
        ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
        cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

    4. CSS Animations
        @keyframes
        animation-name
        animation-duration
        animation-delay
        animation-iteration-count
        animation-direction
        animation-timing-function
        animation-fill-mode
        animation

        Specify the Speed Curve of the Animation
        The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.
        The animation-timing-function property can have the following values:
        ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
        linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
        ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
        ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
        ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
        cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

        CSS Animation Properties:
        The following table lists the @keyframes rule and all the CSS animation properties:

        Property	    Description
        @keyframes - Specifies the animation code
        animation - A shorthand property for setting all the animation properties
        animation-delay - Specifies a delay for the start of an animation
        animation-direction - Specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles
        animation-duration - Specifies how long time an animation should take to complete one cycle
        animation-fill-mode - Specifies a style for the element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both)
        animation-iteration-count - Specifies the number of times an animation should be played
        animation-name - Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation
        animation-play-state - Specifies whether the animation is running or paused
        animation-timing-function - Specifies the speed curve of the animation
