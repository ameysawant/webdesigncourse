        What are Meta Tags -
        Meta tags provide information about the webpage in the HTML of the document. This information is called "metadata" and while it is not displayed on the page itself, it can be read by search engines and web crawlers.
        
        meta charset -
        When you declare the "charset" as "UTF-8", you are telling your browser to use the UTF-8 character encoding, which is a method of converting your typed characters into machine-readable code. 

        meta description -
        The meta description tag in HTML is the 160 character snippet used to summarize a web page's content. Search engines sometimes use these snippets in search results to let visitors know what a page is about before they click on it.

        meta keywords -
        The Meta Keyword tag is used to let Google and other search engines know which keywords were most relevant to the content of a given web page.

        meta author -
        Specifies the name of the author of the document.
