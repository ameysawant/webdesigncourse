    7. Meta Tags
    The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.
    Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="description" content="Kishori Tutorials teach Frontend Technologies.">
      <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap, Photoshop, React.js, Angular, Flexbox">
      <meta name="author" content="Kishori Tutorials">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    </head>

    The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
    You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
    The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
    The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
